# Eat and Smile recipe finder web app

### This is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and javascript. 

This project was an eye-opener for me. I got to understand how to manipulate the DOM using javascript. I also learnt how to fetch data from APIs and render the information in the DOM(Document Object Model)) using backticks. 

While building, I needed to store the user's search terms somewhere I could access them across different pages, so  I learnt how to save items temporarily and retrieve them from local storage. 

I forgot to mention, Error handling. I learnt how to use the "try and catch" statements to handle errors. I learnt a lot because I faced a lot of challenges. Some were sweet some were not.

It is a recipe finder web app. It allows users to search for various food recipes to prepare at home. It displays the ingredients you need and a link to a website that tells you how to prepare the meal. It also provides additional information like the time to prepare the meal.
